# Welcome!

Welcome to my Esri Experience Builder custom widgets repository. This repository is the root repository for the most up to date custom widgets that I have developved, and that are available for public release. Please feel free to use these widgets in your own projects, and share this repository around the GIS community. These widgets do not come with any guarantees, so take care in working them into your own projects.

## Interactive Homepage:

If you want to try out using these widgets, check out my [Experience Builder Homepage](https://exb.luciuscreamer.com/). This is a showcase of the various widgets that I have created which are finalized, or have been tested working with currently desired functionality. Direct links to examples for each widget can also be found in each widget's README.

## Highlights:

- ABLS: A Better Layer Switcher, a widget to allow you to set views of layers, including timeline filtering, to use for making more user friendly view switching experiences (See the [SEMA Daily Brief](https://gis.mo.gov/semabrief) for a use case example.)
- new-radar: A radar viewer to be added to a map widget, allowing for high refresh radar tiles to be viewed and swiped through, using a service worker. Also works with GOES Imagery.
- Calendar: A calendar widget, allowing you to hook up a feature layer to a calendar within Experience builder. Selection, data filtering, message actions, all work.
- CameraViewer: A live traffic camera viewer for .m3u8 feeds. Makes it easy to hook up a layer to the widget to view live camera feeds.
