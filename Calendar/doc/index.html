		<h1>Calendar Widget</h1>
	</div>
	<p>
		This widget is designed to allow the end user to use a calendar interface to
		display data from multiple Experience Builder data sources.<br />
		To use this widget, you need to format your data source appropriately. You
		need the following fields for this widget to work:
		<li>Label - A text field, the label for the event on the calendar</li>
		<li>Date Start - An Esri date field, indicating the start of the event</li>
		<li>Date End - An Esri date field, indicating the end of the event</li>
		<li>
			AllDay - A string field, indicating if the event lasts all day (Values
			must be y or n)
		</li>
		<li>
			Description (optional) - A text field, with a longer description of the
			event, to be displayed when a user hovers over the event
		</li>
		<li>
			Color (optional) - A text field. This can be anything, as you will set the
			values for calendar symbology
		</li>
		<br />
		Each data source that you use will need these fields, but the actual feature
		type can be anything (Table, Point, Line, Polygon ...) Additional
		datasources can be added using the (Add Dataset) button in the top right of
		the window.<br />
		Message actions are also set up to support selecting features by clicking
		them on the calendar. One common workflow would be to zoom to a specific
		event point when the event is clicked on the calendar. To do this, go to the
		"Action" tab and add a trigger for "Record Selection Changes" and set your
		map widget to "Zoom To".<br />
		This widget would not be possible without the
		<a href="https://fullcalendar.io">fullcalendar.io javascript library</a>. Be
		sure to check them out. Visit the
		<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/exb-calendar">NPM page</a> for more
		information. <br /><br />This Experience Builder widget was developed by
		Lucius Creamer.
