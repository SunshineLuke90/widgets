# Flood Inundation Map Layer Switcher

This widget is designed to provide a slider to be able to quickly swap between flood inundation map panels, similar to the [USGS Flood Inundation map viewer application](https://fim.wim.usgs.gov/fim/).

This widget has not been put into use, and is therefore a rough draft. More testing/development is needed before this widget sees production.
